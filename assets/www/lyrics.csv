Send her victorious, Happy and glorious, Long to reign over us, God save the Queen. Thy choicest gifts in store On her be pleased to pour, Long may she reign; May she defend our laws, And ever give us cause To sing with heart and voice, God save the Queen! God bless our native land, May heaven's protective hand Still guard our shore; May peace her power extend, Foe be transformed to friend, And Britain's power depend On war no more. May just and righteous laws Uphold the public cause, And bless our isle. Home of the brave and free, Fair land and liberty, We pray that still on thee Kind heaven may smile. And not this land alone-But be thy mercies known From shore to shore. Lord, make the nations see That men should brothers be, And from one family The wide world o'er.");
